# Resume Bullet Points - Agri-Acoustic Sentinel

## Quick Bullet Points (Choose 3-5 for resume)

• Developed full-stack AI-powered bioacoustic pest detection system using React, Node.js, Express, and Facebook's ImageBind model for real-time agricultural monitoring

• Integrated local ImageBind AI model via Python subprocess communication, implementing audio-to-embedding conversion and similarity matching for pest signature detection

• Built responsive React dashboard with real-time WebSocket updates, interactive field maps (Leaflet), and data visualizations (Recharts) with dark mode UI

• Deployed containerized application using Docker multi-stage builds, Railway (backend), and Netlify (frontend) with automated CI/CD pipelines

• Implemented RESTful APIs, WebSocket server (Socket.IO), file upload handling, and scheduled tasks for continuous field monitoring with real-time alerts

• Configured cross-origin communication between services, environment variable management, health checks, and monitoring endpoints for production deployment

• Designed and implemented dark mode UI with Tailwind CSS, optimized layouts for screen space efficiency, and created consistent design system

• Solved complex technical challenges including Python-Node.js inter-process communication, JSON parsing from mixed stdout/stderr, and Docker containerization for AI dependencies
